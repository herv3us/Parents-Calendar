# Calendar ðŸ“†

I'm making a small and hopefullu kind of simple calendar for my parents, with a special feature to it.
As a friend or family to my parents, you are suppouse to have the ability to send in requests on doing stuff together, like visiting them for a few days in Portugal or just have a nice dinner together when they visit their relatives in Sweden.

So, a calendar for them, where they can see all their planed events and at the same time able to take requests from others right in to their calendar...
