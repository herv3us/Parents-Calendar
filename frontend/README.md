# Calendar for my parents

Creating a calendar for my parents. They wished for a simpel calendar that they can see when they are booked for stuff and when they are free.
But at the same time they want it to be a little bit special... They want the calendar to have a feature where other people can send in requests to do stuff with them, on times/days they are free...
